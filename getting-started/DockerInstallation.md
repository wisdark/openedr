### Docker installation

 * For Linux distros visit and follow instructions at https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/
    * in our example we used Ubuntu-Server 22.04 LTS you may go with that since gnome-terminal which is needed by docker.
 simply run with the order
 ```console
  apt-get update
  apt-get upgrade
  apt install docker
 ```
 use sudo if you don't have root access
